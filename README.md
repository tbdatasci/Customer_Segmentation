# Customer_Segmentation
This is a Udacity project using machine learning to perform customer segmentation.  I compared demographics for the population as a whole against the demographics of a company's customer base.  From there, I could see which types of demographics were most likely to be customers.  The clustering was done using k-means, which is a form of unsupervised machine learning.
